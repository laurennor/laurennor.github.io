  <h2 class="welcome">Welcome to my site!</h2>

  <p>This site has recently been given a much needed redesign to make it more mobile responsive.</p>
  <p>Lately, I've been working hard on my Android apps and Java projects. I'm a developer who loves mobile. Before mobile, I also studied some web developement--JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and Ruby.</p>
  <p>Stay tuned for both mobile and web projects!</p>
  <p>Also, feel free to check out some of my blog posts or reach out to me through social media. I'm most active on Twitter.</p>
