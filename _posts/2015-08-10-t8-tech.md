##What is Rails?##

###Week 8 of DBC's Remote Prepwork###

###08/10/2015###

This week I did a little research on Rails for my technical blog assignment. Prior to my research, I only knew of Rails as a framework of the Ruby programming language. A frameworks is a layered structure that applications are built one. According to the RailsGuide, site I was on the right track in my assumption but it is more specifically "web application development framework." This means that it's sole purpose to make developing web applications in Ruby easier. The RailsGuide site states that "it allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks." With this in mind, it makes sense that Ruby tends to be the more commonly taught language to beginner developers by coding schools. When I first started searching for coding schools, I noticed a trend in that most of them taught Ruby on Rails. As with Ruby, Rails carries a Don't Repeat Yourself rule and adheres to creating code with more simplicity.

Before using Rails, you must install it on your computer. If you're on a Mac, you use Terminal while on Windows you would open command prompt. You will also need to have Ruby installed on your computer to take advantage of the Ruby on Rails experience.
