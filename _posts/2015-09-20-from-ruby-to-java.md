title: From Ruby to Java

Before I typed my first line of code, I wanted to create an Android app. The truth is I've never owned an iPhone. When I returned to the U.S. after living in Japan, I was already set on getting a Motorola Atrix in 2011. I would say I was obsessed with the phone for about two weeks because I was in awe of what it could do. Then, when I upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy S3 I started buying more customization apps to change the look of my phone. However, as a beginner starting out I thought Java would be too difficult. After all, most of the research I gathered were listing Ruby as one of the top languages for beginners. When I started applying for coding bootcamps, creating an Android app always managed to make an appearance in those 2-5 year goal questions.

After leaving after one week of a web immersive program, I enrolled in a school focused on mobile development. I knew I made the right decision especially since I was told their Android curiculum was based off of Hunter College's Android course platform. Though this program did not require pre-work, I started working through John Purcell's [Java Tutorial for Complete Beginners][java-tutorial] before I started.

First impressions of Java? Well, I didn't hate it like quite a few developers I met who coded with it in the past. I also no longer felt intimidated by it which I think had to prep-work in other programming languages. One thing I did find frustrating was how much code it took to do a simple task.

*Ruby example:*
{% highlight ruby %}
print "Hello World!"
#-->Hello World!
{% endhighlight %}

*Java example:*
{% highlight java %}
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World"!);
  }
}
#-->Hello World!
{% endhighlight %}

Unlike Ruby, Java requires more detail. Since it requires a .class and .java file, Java developers tend to an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to compile their code. So far, I've been using [Eclipse][eclipse-ide] since that's the IDE that the instructor of Udemy course I'm working through is using. During my first day, I found out this was also the IDE my school was using for their program.
