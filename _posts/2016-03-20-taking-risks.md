“Surround yourself with the dreamers and the doers, the believers and thinkers, but most of all, surround yourself with those who see the greatness within you, even when you don’t see it yourself.” ― Edmund Lee

After a frustrating two months of slow progress, I decided to make a change. Sometimes doing what is best means stepping away from a routine that is no longer working. It is possible I was weighed down by some unexpected hurdles earlier their year but it was time to bounce back. Rather than focusing on the decision I made and occurences that were beyond my control, I chose to surround myself with the positive energy of people I admire. They are friends, former classmates, coding buddies, family, and mentors who've believed in me even when I was having doubts.

One thing I believe that helped get my coding flow back was changing the atmosphere. When I started studying at co-working spaces, I became more focused and suddenly felt lighter than I had in months. In terms of co-working spaces, [Alley Chelsea][Alley] and [AWS Loft][AWS Loft] are pretty amazing. The colors in the space are warm and inviting. You're also able to meet people from the tech community. I met some who had some leads on development jobs as well.

When I left my position in finance, one of the things I promised myself was to focus on my goals and do whatever it takes to achieve them. I have BA in Liberal Arts yet somehow I worked hard enough to enter the corporate finance operations department. Traditionally, many who major in accounting end up in finance and it's not surprising. However, I believe having a non-traditional background is also powerful because it has made me more resilient especially towards people who've said I couldn't accomplish certain things I've done or think I can't reach the goals I currently aim for.
