“Surround yourself with the dreamers and the doers, the believers and thinkers, but most of all, surround yourself with those who see the greatness within you, even when you don’t see it yourself.” ― Edmund Lee

After a frustrating two months of slow progress, I decided to a make a change. Sometimes doing what is best for you means stepping away from a routine that no longer works. It is possible I was weighed down by some unexpected hurdles earlier their year but it was time to bounce back. Rather than focusing on the choices I've made that were now beyond my control, I chose to surround myself with the positive energy of people I admire. They are friends, former classmater, family, and mentors who've always believed in me even when I was having doubts. One thing I believe that helped get my coding flow back was changing the atmosphere. When I started studying at co-working spaces, I became more focused and suddenly felt lighter than I had in months. In terms of co-working spaces, [Alley Chelsea][Alley] and [AWS Loft][AWS Loft] are pretty amazing. The colors in the space are warm and inviting. You're also able to meet people from the tech community.

When I left my position in finance, one of the things I promised myself was that I would focus on my goals and do whatever it takes to achieve them. I have BA in Liberal Arts yet somehow I worked hard enough to enter corporate finance operations. Traditionally, many who major in accounting end up in finance and it's not surprising. However, I believe having a non-traditional background is also powerful because it has made me more resilient especially towards people who've said I couldn't accomplish some of the things I've done or think I can't reach the goals I'm currently aiming for.
