Yesterday, I attended GDG NYC's Google I/O Extended Event. It began at 5pm and ended at 9pm. I really appreciated the fact that the organizers put this together because I couldn't attend Google I/O in Mountain View, CA due to finance restraints. However, next year if I get an Google I/O invite ticket, I'll be ready to fly there! :D

One of the biggest announcements was new Firebase. When I attended a Firebase Workshop at Google HQ last year, we created a web project using Twilio. Now Firebase can be use for web, iOS, and Android. At the Google I/O Extended Event, they highly recommended that we watch [Firebase's Zero-to-App][Zero-to-App] YouTube presentation. In the video, they created a project using all three.

And last but certainly not least, the Google Developer Certification for Android announcement. I can't say I've ever been this excited about an exam. Since I'm self-taught, I love the idea of being able to test my level of proficiency and skill by passing the [Associate Android Developer][Google Dev Certification] exam.

For the Associate Android Developer exam preparation, the site recommends the online course [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals][Android Fundamentals] developed by Google and Udacity or taking  General Assembly's [Android immersive][GA Android] course.
