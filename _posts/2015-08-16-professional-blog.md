title: More Jekyll Than Hyde
tags: other, jekyll

Recently, I decided to use Jekyll on my site. Jekyll is a static blog. One of the things I like about it is that it minimizes the amount of HTML and CSS I needed to add content to my site. Instead of having to apply CSS links and HTML code to every page I create, it allows me to store the information in "includes" and "layouts" folders.

One of the trickier things about Jekyll was understanding how it compilies my site content. It took some trial and error but I'm happy with the overall design. Now, I can write my blog posts without having to worry about HTML and CSS coding. With this in mind, I would say the structure of my site has become more Jekyll than Hyde.
